  To translate the web interface to another language you need to use the 
English language as base.

  The app modules (application/modules) contain "language" directory.
Each subdirectory represents a language translation.
  By default there's only one language - English (en).
  
  For each directory in application/modules do the following:
  
1. Copy the en/ directory to another one named with the language code you're
   going to translate to. (Example: de/)
   
2. With your favourite text editor, edit each of the ini files and translate
   the values (on the right side of the = sign)
   
   Example:
     EN: form_element_label_password = "Password"
	 DE: form_element_label_password = "Passwort"
	 
   Note: There might be special switches in the translations such as %s and %d,
         these are replaced by variables from the system so try to keep them
		 in your translations.
		 
3. Move to the next module while you translate texts in all modules

   After translation is completed, you need to edit the
application/configs/application.ini
   Locate the following line:
   
			resources.translate.locale = "en"
   and replace "en" with your new language code.
   
   Example:
			resources.translate.locale = "de"
			
	Now go to the web interface URL and check if its now
being loaded with your translations.
